1.Signal Reading and Visualization: Reads EEG signals from EDF files and plots channel-wise data.
2.Feature Extraction: Computes band powers (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta) using the Welch method.
3.Comparison: Visualizes and compares mean band powers for healthy vs. depressed groups.
4.Frequency Decomposition: Highlights frequency bands for a selected channel.
